# Notes
# I don't know how to make strings in Puppet, so comments will do for now

# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-Puppet
# About:
# I decided to make Puppet the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Puppet) as Puppet is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Puppet programming language. It only makes sense to Puppet the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
